Malware uses networks to spread, steal data, or receive commands from hackers. By checking network traffic, people can find suspicious activity that might mean malware is present. This includes unusual website requests, strange domain lookups, and repeated connections to certain servers. Tools like Wireshark help find these threats by filtering and analyzing network data.

How to Detect Malicious HTTP POST Requests

Open Wireshark and load the network capture file. In the Filter bar, type http && frame contains "POST" and press Enter. Look for POST requests going to unknown or suspicious websites. Right-click a packet and follow the HTTP stream to check if the data looks strange or encoded.

How to Analyze Suspicious DNS Queries

In Wireshark, type dns.qry.name contains "suspiciousdomain.com" in the Filter bar and press Enter. Look for repeated requests to domains linked to malware. Compare the domain name with security reports to see if it’s a known threat. Watch for unusual patterns, such as too many random-looking domain requests.

How to Identify Beaconing Behavior

Use the filter ip.dst == x.x.x.x && tcp.flags == 0x02, replacing x.x.x.x with a suspicious server’s IP. Check for repeated connections happening at set time intervals. Look for small, regular packets, which might mean malware is secretly sending signals to a hacker’s server.

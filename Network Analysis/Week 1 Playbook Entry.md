Network traffic analysis means looking at data moving through a network to find problems, detect attacks, and improve performance. By studying these data packets, people can spot unusual activity, investigate security issues, and keep networks safe. Tools like Wireshark help by showing detailed network traffic, making it easier to understand what’s happening.

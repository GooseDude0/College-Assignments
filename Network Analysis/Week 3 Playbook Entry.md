Logging and interpreting flow traffic using the statistics tools in Wireshark. 

The main tools for analysing flow traffic are Protocol Hierarchy, Conversations, I/O Graphs, and Flow Graph.

Interpretation

Protocol Hierarchy
  This tool shows a breakdown of the protocols in the capture file and how they relate to each other.

Conversations
  This tool provides a detailed summary of all the network conversations (flows) based on various protocols such as TCP, UDP, etc.

I/O Graphs
  This tool provides a graphical representation of packet traffic over time.

Flow Graph
  This tool shows the sequence of packets exchanged between two hosts in a conversation.

Logging

You can do 2 things to log the traffic for later anaylysis.

1. Exporting Packet Data
  After applying relevant filters to identify flows of interest, you can export packets using File -> Export Specified Packets.

2. Capture Options
  You can also set Wireshark to log specific types of flows during live captures by adjusting Capture Options (under Capture â†’ Options) and specifying the relevant filter to capture the traffic you're interested in.

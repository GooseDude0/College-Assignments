Advanced Threat Detection is the process of finding and stopping cyber threats that regular security tools might miss. Hackers keep changing their tactics, so security teams must use smart methods like the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, behavior analysis, and threat intelligence. By combining automated tools with proactive threat hunting, organizations can spot and stop attacks before they cause serious damage.

The MITRE ATT&CK Framework is a guide that explains how cyber attacks operate. It helps people detect threats by mapping out tactics (attack goals), techniques (methods used), and procedures (specific attack steps). This framework is useful for identifying attack patterns, improving security defenses, and stopping cyber threats early.

MITRE ATT&CK Techniques
Phishing (T1566) – Gaining Access

Attackers send fake emails with harmful links or attachments to trick users.

How to detect it? Watch for unusual emails, suspicious attachments, and strange link behavior.

Privilege Escalation (T1068) – Gaining More Control

Attackers find software flaws to get higher permissions on a system.

How to detect it? Look for unexpected changes in user privileges and unusual system activity.

Data Theft (T1567) – Stealing Information

Attackers upload stolen data to cloud storage services.

How to detect it? Monitor large file transfers, new cloud usage, and unusual data movement.

How Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) Help in Threat Hunting

IoCs are warning signs that show a system might be under attack. People look for IoCs to find hidden threats before they cause damage. Examples include:

Suspicious IP Addresses – A computer connecting to known hacker servers.

Weird File Changes – Important files being modified without reason.

Strange Network Activity – Large amounts of data leaving the system unexpectedly.

By tracking these signs, people can stop attacks before they spread.

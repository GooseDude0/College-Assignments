Wireshark Filtering

Filters can be used to find a specific aspect of some of the captured packets.

Example:

If you want to find out how many or which packets used the protocol "TCP", click where it says "Apply a display filter ..." type in "TCP" and hit Enter. You should now be looking at any and all packets in the capture that used the TCP protocol.

Same goes for just about any specific detail you need to find.
